# fslint 3
Linux file system lint checker/cleaner

A fork to begin tracking the work to update the codebase to Python 3 and Gtk 3.

The new version of fslint will appropriately be updated to 3.x


---
For the curious, work will begin by running the code through trivial update filters
and then manually fixing whatever cannot automatically be done by those scripts and filters.
